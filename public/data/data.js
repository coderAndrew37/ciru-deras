      <p><i class="fas fa-home"></i> Have you ever walked into someone’s house and thought, <em>‘Wow, this place feels like home!’</em>? It's not about expensive furniture or a massive space—it’s the vibe. Making your house feel like home is about adding personal touches that bring out <strong>you</strong>.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-couch"></i> Start with basics: cozy cushions, throw blankets, and a few <em>statement pieces</em>. <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Plants? They’re a game-changer! Even if you're not a plant parent, easy-to-care-for options like snake plants or pothos are perfect.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Finally, make your walls speak. Add a gallery wall with family photos or art pieces from local artists. If you’re feeling bold, try a feature wall with a splash of color.</p>
      <p><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> The key? Authenticity. Don't worry about trends—create a space that feels <em>yours</em>, and trust me, it’ll always feel like home.</p>

      <p><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Interior design trends are ever-evolving, and 2024 is no exception. The focus this year? <strong>Natural elements</strong>, <strong>bold colors</strong>, and <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>
      <h3>1. Bring Nature Indoors</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Think plants, natural wood, and earthy textures. From rattan furniture to jute rugs, these elements bring warmth and calm into any room.</p>
      <h3>2. Bold Colors</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Neutral tones are taking a backseat, as vibrant colors like terracotta, emerald green, and mustard yellow steal the show. A pop of bold color can transform your walls, furniture, or accessories.</p>
      <h3>3. Sustainable Choices</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-recycle"></i> Eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled wood, and upcycled furniture are making their mark. Sustainability is not just a trend—it’s the future.</p>

      <p><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Lighting is everything in interior design. It’s not just about brightening a space; it’s about creating an atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>1. Ambient Lighting</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-sun"></i> This is your room’s main source of light. Ceiling fixtures, chandeliers, or recessed lighting provide a warm, consistent glow.</p>
      <h3>2. Task Lighting</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-lamp"></i> Focused lighting for specific tasks, like reading lamps or under-cabinet kitchen lights. They’re practical but stylish!</p>
      <h3>3. Accent Lighting</h3>
      <p><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Highlight specific features in your room, like a piece of art or a bookshelf. Accent lights add depth and drama.</p>
      <p>Lighting can make or break your design, so choose wisely!</p>
